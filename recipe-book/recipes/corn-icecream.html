<center><h2>Description</h2></center>
<center><p>This corn ice cream is also a no-churn recipe, which means it's easier than any classic homemade ice cream ever dreamed of being. That's ideal when summer is rushing into fall and you're chasing the last beautiful drops of fresh, right-from-the-field corn and the satisfaction it provides in all formsâ€”yes, even ice cream.</p></center>

<center><h3>Ingredients</h3></center>
<ul>
    <li>3 large (9 oz. each) ears fresh yellow corn</li>
    <li>2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li>1 (14-oz.) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
    <li>1/8 tsp. table salt</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp. light corn syrup</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
    <li>Fresh basil leaves, for garnish (optional)</li>
</ul>
    
<center><h3>Steps</h3></center>
    
<ol>
    <li>Cut kernels from corn to yield about 2 1/4 cups, reserving cobs.</li>
    <li>Add corn kernels, reserved cobs, heavy cream, condensed milk, and salt to a large Dutch oven. Bring to a simmer over medium; reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, stirring constantly until kernels are just tender, about 6 minutes.</li>
    <li>Transfer to a large heatproof bowl; chill in refrigerator, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until cold, about 3 hours.</li>
    <li>Remove corn cobs, scraping any liquid back into bowl before discarding.</li>
    <li>Strain corn mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl, pressing to release as much liquid as possible.</li>
    <li>Whisk in corn syrup and vanilla. Reserve kernels in an airtight container in refrigerator for garnish, if desired.</li>
    <li>Beat cream mixture with an electric mixer on medium speed until aerated and fluffy, about 6 minutes.</li>
    <li>Spread mixture in a freezer-safe 9- x 5-inch loaf pan. Place a sheet of plastic wrap directly on the surface. Freeze until firm, at least 6 hours or up to 1 week.</li>
    </ol>
