        <h2 class = "desc">Description</h2>
        <p class = "desc">Chicken scallopini is ready for even your craziest weeknights. It takes 30 minutes and is made in just one skillet. Scallopini or scaloppine denotes an Italian dish composed of thinly sliced meat (most often beef, veal, or chicken) dredged in flour, pan-fried, and finished with a rich sauce. Depending on the dish, the sauce may feature wine, mushrooms, lemon, tomato, or other classic ingredients.</p>

        <h3 class = "p-paddings">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Boneless, skinless chicken breasts: Pounded thin for quick cooking.</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and black pepper: Seasons the chicken.</li>
            <li>All-purpose flour: A light coating for the chicken.</li>
            <li>Olive oil: For cooking the chicken breasts; feel free to substitute with any preferred oil with a high smoke point.</li>
            <li>Unsalted butter: The rich base of the mushroom sauce.</li>
            <li>Cremini mushrooms: A mild, earthy mushroom; can be substituted with other preferred varieties, including white mushrooms or assorted wild mushrooms.</li>
            <li>Shallots: For a mild, oniony flavor.</li>
            <li>Dry white wine: Adds acidity and depth to the sauce.</li>
            <li>Heavy whipping cream: For a sauce with a velvety texture and creamy flavor.</li>
            <li>Flat-leaf parsley: Adds a pop of color and freshness.</li>
            <li>Lemon zest: A kick of citrusy flavor to brighten the dish.</li>

        <h3 class = "p-paddings">Steps</h3>
    
        <ol>
            <li>Make chicken cutlets, and flatten: Cut chicken in half horizontally, then place between pieces of plastic wrap and pound to flatten to a 1/2-inch thickness.</li>
            <li>Season and dredge chicken cutlets: Season cutlets with 3/4 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper. Dredge in 1/2 cup flour.</li>
            <li>Cook chicken cutlets: Heat oil in a large cast-iron skillet; cook chicken until golden brown, then flip and cook through. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate; cover to keep warm.</li>
            <li>Cook mushroom and shallots for sauce: Add butter to skillet and melt. Add mushrooms, shallots, and remaining salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until mushrooms are browned.</li>
            <li>Finish sauce: Add remaining flour and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add wine, and cook, stirring often, until reduced by half. Stir in cream, parsley, and zest; remove from heat.</li>
